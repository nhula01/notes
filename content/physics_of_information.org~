There are some constraints on our ability to use and manipulate the information

For example:

1) Landauer's principle
   Erasure of information is a dissipative process (irreversible). By removing information, we are
   essentially creating an entropy $$\delta S=k \ln{2}$$
2) Reversible computation
   Logic gates that perform computation are typically irreversible. For example, the NAND gate
   $$(a, b) \rightarrow \neg (a \land b)$$
   We could see that one bit is erased from this process. A work is needed to operate the gate $$W = kT \ln 2$$.
   In theory, we can construct any computation using only reversible steps that preserve all the information (Toffolo) gate
   $$(a, b, c) \rightarrow (a, b, c \oplus a \land b)$$. However, the Landauer's principle in practice does not
   matter for engineering problem because we have overcome this limitation to even care about
3) Maxwell's demon
   A thought experiment by Maxwell that shows the erasure of information costs energy
