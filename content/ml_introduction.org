* Types of Learning

** Supervised (Inductive) learning

- This study is done when the training data and desired outputs (labels) are given

- There are a few algorithms in supervised learning:


1) Regression
   Given a set of $$ (x_i,y_i)$$, we use the set to train the function $$ f(x)$$ to
   predict y given any value of x.
2) Classification
   We still train like regression with a different model. In this model, the outputs
   y are classified (like 0 or 1).
** Unsuperivsed Learning

- We are only given the data to train without the desired outputs

- Given x which can have dimension d, each dimention is an attribute.

- The study of the output will give us some hidden structure of x's
** Semi-supervised learning

- Similar to supervised learning, but only a few desired outputs are given


** Reinforcement learning

- We give rewards for the actions done
