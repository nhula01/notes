A hilbert space is defined as

For any vector in the hilbert space.

1.  It is a vector space over the complex numbers \\[\mathbb{C}\\]. Vectors will be denoted \ket{\psi}.
2.  It has an inner product \\[ \braket{\psi}{\phi}\\] that maps an ordered pair of vectors to \\[\mathbb{C}\\],
    and that has the properties:

    i) Positivity: \\[ \braket{\psi}{\psi} > 0 \\] for \\[ \ket{\psi} \neq 0\\]

    ii) Linearity: \\[ \bra{\phi} (a \ket{\psi\_1} + b \ket{\psi\_2}) = a \braket{\psi}{\phi\_1} + b \braket{\psi}{\phi\_2}\\]

    iii) Skew symmetry:\\[ \braket{\psi|\phi} = \braket{\phi|\psi}^{\\\\*}\\]
3.  It is complete in the norm \\[|\psi| = \bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}^{\frac{1}{2}}\\]
